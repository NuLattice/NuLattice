# Recommended steps for contributors

Contributors to `NuLattice` should follow the general steps of:
1. [Forking](https://github.com/NuLattice/NuLattice/fork) the repository;
2. Adding new developments, fixes, optimizations, or other contributions in a new branch (not `main`);
3. And merging their contributions back to the main repository via a [pull request](https://github.com/NuLattice/NuLattice/pulls).

Below we provide instructions on how contributors can do this step by step, including instructions on making new developments private until they are ready to be made public and merged back into the main repository.
